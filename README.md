## What is stats.store?

If you have a Mac app that uses [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) for updates, stats.store gives you basic analytics without being creepy about it. Think of it as a friendly way to answer simple questions:

- How many people use my app?
- What macOS versions should I support?
- Are people actually updating when I release new versions?

**What we collect:**

- macOS version and CPU type (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
- App version numbers
- Daily unique users (anonymized)
- Basic hardware info (RAM, Mac model)

**What we DON'T collect:**

- No IP addresses or personal data
- No usage tracking or behavior analytics
- No creepy fingerprinting
- No third-party trackers

## Free for Open Source

Building an open source Mac app? It's completely free! Just [email Peter](mailto:peter@steipete.me) and he'll add your app.

## How It Works (The Magic Part! ‚ú®)

Here's the clever bit: instead of modifying your app's code, stats.store acts as a friendly middleman for your Sparkle updates. When your app checks for updates, it goes through stats.store, which:

1. Notes that someone is using your app (anonymously!)
2. Fetches your real update file from GitHub/wherever
3. Passes it along to your app

Your users get their updates, you get your stats. Everyone wins!

### Setting It Up (It's Just One URL Change!)

In your app's `Info.plist`, change your update URL from:
\`\`\`xml
<key>SUFeedURL</key>
<string>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/you/yourapp/main/appcast.xml</string>
\`\`\`

To:
\`\`\`xml
<key>SUFeedURL</key>
<string>https://stats.store/api/v1/appcast/appcast.xml</string>
\`\`\`

That's it! stats.store will automatically find your real appcast file and serve it while collecting anonymous stats.

## The Dashboard
