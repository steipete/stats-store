## Overview

If you have a Mac app that uses [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) for updates, stats.store gives you basic analytics without being creepy about it. Think of it as a friendly way to answer simple questions:

- How many people use my app?
- What macOS versions should I support?
- Are people actually updating when I release new versions?

### Privacy First

**What we collect:**

- macOS version and CPU type (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
- App version numbers
- Daily unique users (anonymized)
- Basic hardware info (RAM, Mac model)

**What we DON'T collect:**

- No IP addresses or personal data
- No usage tracking or behavior analytics
- No creepy fingerprinting
- No third-party trackers

### Free for Open Source

Building an open source Mac app? It's completely free! Just [email Peter](mailto:peter@steipete.me) and he'll add your app. Read the [full story of stats.store](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/stats-store-privacy-first-sparkle-analytics) and learn how it came to be!

## Getting Started

### How It Works ‚ú®

Instead of modifying your app's code, stats.store acts as a friendly middleman for your Sparkle updates:

1. Your app checks for updates through stats.store
2. We note that someone is using your app (anonymously!)
3. We fetch your real update file and pass it along
4. Your users get their updates, you get your stats!

### Setup (One URL Change!)

In your app's `Info.plist`, change your update URL from:

```xml
<key>SUFeedURL</key>
<string>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/you/yourapp/main/appcast.xml</string>
```

To:

```xml
<key>SUFeedURL</key>
<string>https://stats.store/api/v1/appcast/appcast.xml</string>
```

That's it! stats.store will automatically find your real appcast file and serve it while collecting anonymous stats.

### View Your Stats

Check out your dashboard at [stats.store](https://stats.store) to see:

- Daily active users
- macOS version breakdown (pretty charts!)
- CPU architecture distribution
- Version adoption rates
